I'm a recent Information Systems graduate from Cal Poly Pomona ('21) and a tech enthusiast. After graduation, I pivoted from IT and took some time off to pursue my interests in programming and web development.
After six months with the Odin Project curriculum, I've programmed some pretty worthwhile projects. Nonetheless, after that experience, I have to say I've realized in that time that my real passion is not writing code, but in helping people, and henceforth I've returned to IT.
Nonetheless, what I've learnt during that time is not vain; building web apps have helped me become a better problem solver. With those technical skills, my troubleshooting experience from past IT roles, and team member qualities that I've refined from my experiences leading various group projects in college, I'm confident that my skills be leveraged to make meaningful contributions toward any businesses' IT.
