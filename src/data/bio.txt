I'm a recent Business Administration / Information Systems graduate from Cal Poly Pomona ('21) and an aspiring front-end developer. When I was an undergrad, I took several web development courses of which sparked my affinity for building websites and programming web apps. Thus, I decided to switch career paths from IT, and undertook a 6-month endeavor after graduating to continue learning more about web development. I have self-taught myself the latest technologies via the Odin Project. Please scroll below to see some of the projects that I've accomplished. Thanks for visiting my website!
