I'm a recent Business Administration / Information Systems graduate from Cal Poly Pomona ('21) and an aspiring front-end developer. When I was an undergrad, I took several web development courses of which sparked my affinity in building websites and programming web apps. Thus, I decided to switch career paths from IT after graduating to continue learning more about web development.
Nonetheless, what I had learnt in my undergrad was not for naught; various employment and group project experiences have allowed me to refine my qualities as a team member whilst exposing me to a wide breadth of technologies used in IT today.
After following the Odin Project's curriculum and other free online resources for 6 months, I have self-taught myself JavaScript, React.js, and other various technologies used in front-end development. Now, my goal is to be able to contribute my skills towards actual business operations.
