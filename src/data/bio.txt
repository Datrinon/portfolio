I'm a recent Business Administration / Information Systems graduate from Cal Poly Pomona ('21) and an aspiring front-end developer. When I was an undergrad, I took several web development courses of which sparked my affinity for building websites and programming web apps. Thus, I decided to switch career paths from IT, and undertook a 6-month endeavor after graduating to continue learning more about web development. Through the Odin Project's curriculum, I have self-taught myself JavaScript and React. Now my main goal is to continue learning in an environment where I can contribute to actual business processes.
