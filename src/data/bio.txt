I'm a recent Business Administration / Information Systems graduate from Cal Poly Pomona ('21) and an aspiring front-end developer. When I was an undergrad, I took several web development courses of which sparked my affinity for building websites and web apps. Thus, I decided to switch career paths from IT, and embarked on a journey learning more about web development after graduating.
Nonetheless, what I had learnt in my undergrad was not in vain; various employment and group project experiences have refined my qualities as a team member whilst teaching me how to adapt and quickly learn the wide breadth of technologies used in IT today.
After following the Odin Project's curriculum and other free online resources for 6 months, I have self-taught myself JavaScript, React.js, and other various technologies used in front-end development. Now, my goal is to be able to contribute my skills towards actual business operations.
